CPU Architecture
==

In this project, my partner and I were given the task of designing two-stage CPU where the pipeline happened between the instruction fetch and the instruction decode. To make a working CPU, we had to design an ALU, registers, and how to link these up with memory and instructions. Below are pictures of each particular part. The entire CPU was designed in logisim.
